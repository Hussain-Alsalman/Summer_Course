## Titanic Story

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Exploring the data 

In order to start with our task. We need to first read the data and understand it. In the `datasets` folder, you will find both the training dataset (`titanic_train.csv`) and the testing dataset (`titanic_test.csv`). Perform the ncessary analysis to understand the data better. In the following exercises you will get to see

*Note* : You can find [data description here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)


```{r reading-data, message=FALSE}
## Reading train and test data 
## train data 
file_path_tr <- here("datasets", "titanic_train.csv")
file_path_te <- here("datasets", "titanic_test.csv")

train_df <- read_csv(file = file_path_tr)
test_df <- read_csv(file = file_path_te)
```

After reading the data we would like to explore them and get an idea about them. We can use `str()` function or `glimpse()` from `dplyr` package.


```{r data-structure, message=FALSE}
## Explor data structure 
glimpse(train_df)
```

## Handeling missing data

It seems that we have few missing data. Let's explor how many and what percentage of the total records.

```{r}
# number of missing data 
apply(train_df, MARGIN = 2, function(x){sum(is.na(x))})
#percentage of missing data 
apply(train_df, MARGIN = 2, function(x){
  round(sum(is.na(x))/dim(train_df)[1],2)})

```

```{r}
library("visdat")
library("naniar")
# We will drop the Cabin because it has 70% missing data. However, we would like to keep the Age. Therefore, we will try to impute the values with KNN method. 
vis_miss(train_df)


```

# Invistigating missing data 

There is abnormal trend in the missing data in comparison with the non missing data. Therefore, we can use models to impute the values. Here we will use the median

```{r}
ggplot(train_df, mapping = aes(x =Cabin, y = Age)) + geom_miss_point() + coord_flip() + facet_grid(Sex~Survived)
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = train_df, mapping = aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(.~Pclass)

ag_median <- median(train_df$Age, na.rm = TRUE)
# we make new copy of the clean data
train_df_cl <- train_df
train_df_cl[which(is.na(train_df_cl$Age)),"Age"] <- ag_median
```


### Discuss how you decided to handel missing data

## Feature selection 

We will keep Fare, Sex and Age and number of siblings and parents. The rest might have value for us but will require text processing which is out of the scoop of this course. 

```{r}

train_df_cl

```
