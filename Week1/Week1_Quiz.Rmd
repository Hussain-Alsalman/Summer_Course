## Data Science Concepts

### Multiple Choice Quiz 

```{r q1}
  question("What is the definition of Data Science?",
    answer("multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods and algorithms to extract knowledge", correct = TRUE),
    answer("multi-disciplinary field that uses statistical methods to predict the target values"),
    answer("It is a computer science field that focus on algorithms and models to gain insight"),
    answer("data science is not actually a science"), 
    allow_retry = TRUE, 
    random_answer_order = TRUE
 
)
```



## Simple Operators




Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r tpt, exercise=TRUE, exercise.checker = check_ex1, exercise.lines =1}

```

```{r tpt-check}
check_ex1(  label,
  user_code,
  solution_code,
  check_code,
  envir_result,
  evaluate_result,
  envir_prep,
  ...)
```
