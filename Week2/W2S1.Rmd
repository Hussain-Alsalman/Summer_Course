## Welcome to Week 2 {.build}

Recap what we learned from Week 1 

- We learn a lot about the 



## Intro to Statistics {.build}

Before we start, we need to mention that Statistics is divided mainly into two parts. 

  - Descriptive Statistics (_Course Focuse_)
    - This branch focuses on describing the Data without making and conclusions 
    
  - Inferential Statistics 
    - This branch is all about making conclusions. It takes sample from the population and try to make statistical tests to generalize the idea. 
    

## Types of data {.build}

In order to be able to describe the data we need to know their types first.

```{r, out.width= '100%' ,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("Images","Data_Types.jpg"))
```

## Catagorical Data {.build}

In many cases especially in classificaiton peroblem this is usually our target variable.

We can describe categorical data by 

- Counts 
- Percentages

However, they are very useful in analytical taks such as 

- Grouping
- Filtering 

# Demo

M&M samples.

```{r, out.width= '100%' ,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here("Images","M&M_spokescandies.png"))
```

## Quantative Data {.build}

Those are excat variables and open doors for many statistical analysis. 

We can describe quantative data by 

- Measure of cerntrality 
    - Mean
    - Median 
    - Mode 

- Measure of Variability 
    - Range 
    - Interquartile Range (IQR)
    - Standard Deviation
    - Variance 

---- {.build}
- Shape
    - Kurtosis 
    - Skewness 
    - Normal Curve or Bell Curve
    
- Outliers

# Let's Practice

## Data Preprocessing {.build}

Why do we preprocess data?

- Fields that are obsolete or redundant
- Missing values
- Outliers
- Data in a form not suitable for the machine learning models;
- Values not consistent with policy or common sense.

## Common Tasks in Data preprocessing {.build}

- Data cleaning
- Handling missing data 
- Identify misclassificaitons 
- Graphically identify * 
- Transformation data _to work better with ML models_ *
- Normalize the data * 

/* _if time permits or next session_
